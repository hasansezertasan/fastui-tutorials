# BMI Calculator

This example is inspired by [PyWebIO][pywebio] [documentation][pywebio-hello-world]. It is the first example in the documentation so I thought it would be a good idea to use it as a starting point for forms in FastUI.

Used Components:

- `PageTitle`
- `Page`
- `Heading`
- `Paragraph`
- `ModelForm`
